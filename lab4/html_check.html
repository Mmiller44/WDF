		<p>Yes, they used the elements correctly. They had an untitled section, but that is acceptable and could be happening for a number of reasons.</p>
		
		<h1>http://www.codeman.co/</h1>
		<p>The structure was input properly. There is an untitled section, but it resulting from a header in the nav. This is acceptable and common. </p>
		
		<h1>http://www.vogue.co.uk/</h1>
		<p>They have 3 untitled parts to their structure. It is very confusing and has tons of elements with in it, but from what I can tell, it looks like they did not name the headings on them or title these sections. It looks like they didn't do this because it would affect a navigation pane that they have made. </p>
		
		<h1>http://keiyasui.com/</p>
		<p>This site has only 2 untitled sections, but they are purposely set because of the navigation and the way the site works with a scrolling nav. No errors. </p>
